  app "InfraEye.app"

  # InfraEye.app carries a valid ad-hoc signature, but it is not signed with an
  # Apple Developer ID and has no notarization ticket, so Gatekeeper rejects it
  # on assessment. Homebrew flags every download with com.apple.quarantine, and
  # a quarantined app that fails assessment is what makes macOS show the
  # misleading "InfraEye.app is damaged and can't be opened" dialog on first
  # launch. Clearing the flag on the copy we just installed is exactly what the
  # old caveat asked users to run by hand; doing it here means a plain
  # `brew install --cask infra-eye` produces an app that opens.
